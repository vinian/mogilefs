# implies mindevcount=2

# classid is what class of file this belongs to.  for instance, on fotobilder
# there will be a class for original pictures (the ones the user uploaded)
# and a class for derived images (scaled down versions, thumbnails, greyscale, etc)

# each class.  fotobilder will use a 2 or 3 minimum copy redundancy for original
# photos and and a 1 minimum for derived images (which means the sole device
# for a derived image can die, bringing devcount to 0 for that file, but 
# the application can recreate it from its original)
