mogile database:

 * add UUID to device table

mogilefsd:

 * when storing files, also store 00003443.meta with info about file
   - this is so we can restore the database if it totally crashes
   - can also store checksumming info in the .meta file?
 * other jobs (replicator & delete, etc) can connect to frontend and do spud-like variable setting
 * fix request pipelining problem (make it an option, though?)
 * host dead cache:
   - when any jobs notices a mogstored state change, send to parent
   - parent rebroadcasts to kids, so they share info
 * UDP between peers for jobs to cross-communicate
   - in conf file, "peers: 10.x.y.z:6001, 10.a.b.c:6001"
 * running fs verifier that makes sure UUIDs from mogstored matches database
   - if a host fails verification, mark it as down
   - configurable "verify time" (default 300 seconds)
   - over 300 seconds, verify another device every N seconds (300/X = N, X = number of devices)
 * rebalancer job (future)
   - moves files around to devices with less files
 * free space weighting
   - every N seconds, using usage file, update database free space columns
   - jobs update their in memory space cache every 60 seconds or so
   - new files go to devices depending on free space (weighted algorithm)
 * checksum files (future)
 * FUSE interface (future)

mogstored:

 * support configuration files
 * allow OPTIONS request
   - include "Date: <gmt date>" header
 * run usage file creator in different thread
 * smartd dump just like usage file
 * fsinfo dump
   - include UUID of fs
   - run in new thread (with usage?)
   - mount -P to get fs types

mogadm:

 * example commands:
   - check
   - <host> add disk <disk>
   - <host> down disk <disk>
   - <host> kill disk <disk>
   - <host> down
   - <host> up

moginit

 * create new mogilefs database
 * perform database upgrades
